# Avocados

This set of experiments was inspired by the dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices/home).

A lot of people make jokes about how much millenials __love__ avocados, so I wanted to quantitatively measure that love and see how machine learning can provide additional insight into avocado consumption of today.

Curious about how consumption of avocados have changed throughout the years, I have parsed the dataset to find simple statistics.

In addition to these statistics, I'd like to know how well the year the avocado was produced can be predicted through its price and location.

In the works: building a classifier to give results to the above statement.
