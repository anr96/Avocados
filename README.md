# Avocados

This set of experiments was inspired by the dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices/home). It was uploaded around June 2018.

A lot of people make jokes about how much millenials __love__ avocados, so I wanted to quantitatively measure that love and see how machine learning can provide additional insight into avocado consumption of today.

## What this repo aims to do
Curious about how consumption of avocados have changed throughout the years, I have parsed the dataset to find simple statistics.
Run `python avocado_stats.py` to :
- Find the average price of an avocado per year and see the changes in a plotted graph
- Find the most popular type of avocado per year and how much of that type was sold 

In addition to these statistics, I'd like to know how well the year the avocado was produced can be predicted through its price and location.

In the works: building a classifier to give results to the above statement.
